# system to interact  with the user before they go  to sleep, in order
# to assess important information useful for systems like RSR

# note that, in  getting it out of the user, you  might want to elicit
# the  information  in a  way  that  doesn't  make them  forget.   For
# instance, ask names before asking for memcons.

# you could use the planner here too.
