# Do  analysis  of  users  key  stroke sequences  using  manager,  for
# instance, you can  recommend to them more efficient  ways of solving
# certain problems.

# By analyzing the  key sequence history against a  database server of
# shortened ways  of doing  things, normal forms  so to speak,  we can
# improve people's usage of Emacs.

# one problem is to know what  is happening based on keystrokes, to be
# able to parse the grammar so  to speak, to know which functions were
# being called and what semantics they would have had.
