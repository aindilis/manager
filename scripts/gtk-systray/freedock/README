Freedock is a Tcl/Tk library for bilding system tray applet
according to the freedesktop system tray spec
http://www.freedesktop.org/Standards/systemtray-spec

It ist licensed under GPL
by Alexander Kreuzer <alex@freesources.org>
(see COPYING).
*BSD compatibility and package
by Emiliano Gavilan <egavilan@eie.fceia.unr.edu.ar>

Requires Tcl/Tk >= 8.4


Compile:

Edit the Makefile to match your system.
Then simply "make" or, if using a non-linux SO (*BSD) "gmake"


Usage:

load ./libfreedock.so
if {[systemtray_exists]} {
	dockwin $win
}
pack [button $win.b]


additionally, you can put libfreedock.so and pkgIndex.tcl files
in your library search path and issue (I do this creating
/usr/local/lib/freedock-0.1 and copying the two files there)


package require Freedock
if {[systemtray_exists]} {
        dockwin $win
}
pack [button $win.b]



Know Problem:
- freedock windows do not have a tansparent background.
  If a colored panel is used, there will be a grey (or other color)
  frame around the dockwin.
