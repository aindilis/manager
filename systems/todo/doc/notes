# this program will be run in between every shell command

# it will update the user with timely reminders about his/her todo list

# it will connect to al.frdcsa.org if on a different host, because
# that is where the central todo system is being kept

# # it shows Emergency tasks in Bold

# it does frequent reminders

# it pulls data from calendars, notifies us of upcoming events...

# it puts stuff from our other planning systems in plain view

# it shows which systems we should be focused on (based on score/pse).


# also include progress reports occasionally

# don't worry about client server at the moment, just implement it here, no wait, that's wrong

# # allow the user to declare silence or a "warn level", to stave off
# # warnings below a threshold of criticality

# find all the existing systems for doing this and incorporate the
# relevant parts, like light, normalform (orig), task, todo, etc.

# warn the user when to take breaks.

# run in the unilang window as well

# for things like, talk to guy at blockbuster, if the system notices
# you are planning on going to blockbuster, mention this as a priority
# item

# develop a model of how frequently someone is shown something

# show priority tasks from PSE
