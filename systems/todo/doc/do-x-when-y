When I eat remind me to take multivitamin.

When I call someone, lookup what I am supposed to tell them.

When I wake up, record dreams.

# First thing when we wake up, ask what sins we committed in sleep, what
# good things we got done, what tests we passed.

When I get my check, deposit it.

# The Manager should send messages to pop up the task list when there is
# a decrease in task joint entropy and it is below acceptable levels.

# Implement items for manager to select the general type of task,
# e.g. reading software, reading manuals, writing software, etc.

Should have it so people can veto given action items.

When we wake up we should have to write a small paper about what we
intend to accomplish.  Upon going to sleep we should then compare
progress and give ourselves a rating.
