;; this is a major mode for tracking what tasks are currently being
;; worked on, including the relationship between tasks.

;; So for instance:

;; (I want to work on AI)
;; (I want to work on packaging existing software)
;; (I want to work on software-indexer)
;; (I have to assert knowledge about downloaded software files, such as where they are from etc)
;; (I have to get it so that I can assert knowledge about files)
;; (I have to work on KBFS-tracker)

;; obviously must interface with the planning systems.

;; use FreeKBS to record the interrelations



;; (log things that we want to do here so that we don't forget them
;;  while we keep working.  Create a stack that allows us to push
;;  things on top of it while we work, like a multidimensional
;;  queue.  Use similar or same keys as freekbs2-stack to edit
;;  manipulate this work context stack.  make it part of do or
;;  normal-form.  use existing do-notation.  Enable persistence
;;  somehow.  integrate with task system, but have them called
;;  microtasks, although some can be major)
